# Marina's Website - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### ✅ 1. Contact Navigation Issue
**Problem**: Clicking "Contact" in the navigation didn't scroll to the contact section.
**Solution**: Added `id="contact"` to the `<section class="artistic-contact">` element.
**File**: `index.html` line 314

### ✅ 2. CTA Button Animations Removed
**Problem**: CTA buttons had unwanted animations and hover effects.
**Solution**: Removed all transitions, hover effects, and shimmer animations from `.hero-circle` class.
**Changes Made**:
- Removed `transition: all 0.3s ease`
- Removed `:hover` effects that moved buttons up/down
- Removed `::before` pseudo-element with shimmer animation
- Removed `@keyframes shimmer` animation
**File**: `styles.css` lines 152-184

### ✅ 3. Image Modal Full Display
**Problem**: Images weren't displaying in full screen properly.
**Solution**: Multiple improvements to ensure full image display:

#### CSS Improvements:
- Increased modal z-index from 9999 to 99999
- Changed modal content max-width/height from 95vw/95vh to 98vw/98vh
- Improved image sizing: `max-width: 98vw; max-height: 98vh; width: auto; height: auto`
- Added flexbox centering to modal content
- Enhanced modal animations and transitions

#### JavaScript Improvements:

**Files Modified**:
- `styles.css`: Modal styles, image hover effects
- `script.js`: Image click handling, modal display logic
